WHAT IS KIMCHI FRIED RICE

    Kimchi fried rice (Kimchi Bokkeumbap, 김치 볶음밥) is a type of Korean fried rice and it is predominantly cooked with kimchi (obviously!) To give it more texture and flavor a variety of meat and/or vegetables are often added.
    Kimchi fried rice is one of the most popular ways to use up your old ripened kimchi along with Kimchi jjigae (Kimchi stew) and Kimchi Pancake.
    Kimchi fried rice is also a great way to use up some of your leftover steamed rice.
