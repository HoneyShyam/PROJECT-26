1. 1 cup kimchi 

2. 150g / 5.3 ounces bacon

3. (optional) 1 pack enoki mushrooms (200g, 7 ounces), root removed, rinse the mushrooms in cold water 
and drain.

4. 3 cups steamed white short/medium grain rice – if it is freshly cooked, leave it out for 5 to 10 mins at room temperature to cool down before cooking.

5. 4 x-large eggs, cooked sunny side up or per your preference

6. 1/2 tsp minced garlic

7. 1/4 cup kimchi juice – this liquid is from the bottom of the kimchi container

8. 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil

9. 1/2 Tbsp cooking oil

10. 1 to 2 Tbsp roasted sesame seeds, to garnish

11. (optional) 1/2 stalk green onion, thinly sliced

12. (optional) roasted seasoned seaweed, shredded

NOTE

     Ideally the kimchi is at least 2 weeks old. If not, add 1/2 tsp rice vinegar into the kimchi juice to make it sour.
     Obtaining 1/4 cup of kimchi juice can be difficult if your kimchi is fairly new. In that case, use 2 1/2  Tbsp kimchi juice and 1 Tbsp gochujang instead. If you want it to be not spicy, you can add 1 Tbsp soy sauce instead of gochujang.
     1 Tbsp = 15 ml, 1 Cup = 250 ml
